<h1>CodeVA Book Club: Computational Thinking</h1>
<p>The <em>CodeVA Book Club</em> is a way for CodeVA folks to learn about and discuss relevant organizational topics by engaging with scholarship from the field of computer science education.</p>
<p>Computational thinking is a term that pops up a lot in computer science education, and people tend to use it in lots of different ways. More important than semantic concerns, however, are the theoretical and practical ones. Computational thinking is a way of describing an epistemology–a way of knowing–about the world by way of or through computing. People use this epistemic lens for all sorts of things; they use it to justify including computing in public school curriculum, they use it to explain the benefits of knowing about computing, and they use it to define a fundamental set of skills and knowledge <em>about</em> computing that transcends domain. If we are to navigate these competing claims to “computational thinking”, it is important for us to understand these claims and appraise them in the context of our mission and philosophy of teaching and learning. This <em>Book Club</em> is about doing just that.</p>
<p>Over the course of several weeks, we will read some important scholarship about computational thinking and weigh its meaning for us and our work. By the end of our engagement with the literature, we should hope to be able to offer our own opinion on computational thinking–what it is, what it is for, and its relationship to our CS education work in CodeVA.</p>
<h2>The Literature</h2>
<p>There are literally hundreds of peer-reviewed articles about computational thinking out there, and all of them have been published within the last 15 years or so. We can’t possibly expect to cover everything. To make our jobs a little easier, we have assembled the following texts which hopefully outline the contours of the scholarly discourse around computational thinking:</p>
<h3>Computational thinking (Wing, 2006)</h3>
<p>Dr. Jeanette Wing’s paper <em>Computational thinking</em> (2006) is as close to the “originating” text of computational thinking as we are likely to get. The conversation starts here.</p>

<h3>Computational thinking in K-12: A review of the state of the field (Grover &amp; Pea, 2013)</h3>
<p>Time passes between Wing’s (2006) originating paper and the the advent of what we might think of as the “contemporary” computing education landscape in the U.S. (e.g., post “CS for all”). This paper summarizes the scholarship during that time, and sets the stage for contemporary re-framings and critiques of computational thinking.</p>

<h3>Remaining trouble spots with computational thinking (Denning, 2017)</h3>
<p>This paper highlights some of the core issues with computational thinking, namely how proponents of CT in K-12 tend to position it as a universally applicable set of problem-solving skills. Denning argues that there is no evidence to support this, and calls for a more narrow definition of CT.</p>

<h3>From theory bias to theory dialogue: Embracing cognitive, situated, and critical framings of computational thinking in K-12 CS education (Kafai, Proctor, &amp; Lui; 2019)</h3>
<p>This paper addresses Denning’s (2017) concerns by reviewing the bulk of scholarship around computational thinking, categorizing conceptions of CT into three broad categories: cognitive, situated, and critical. These framings highlight the tensions and potential miscommunications around computational thinking that are present in the field today.</p>

<h3>A revaluation of computational thinking in K–12 education: Moving toward computational literacies (Kafai &amp; Proctor, 2021)</h3>
<p>This paper extends the work of Kafai, et al. (2019) and establishes an argument for discarding (or at least reconsidering) “computational thinking” as computational <em>literacies</em>. This paper outlines one (of many) contemporary scholarly perspectives about computational thinking.</p>
